## Running the application
The client is set up to run initially with _json-server_ as the mock API server. You may use this for the 
initial client work, then integrate with the API once it is complete. This makes it possible to start with the client
work immediately without dependency on the API.

#### npm Command
```
npm run start:dev:mock
```

#### Clearing the json-server Datbase
Delete the file `./mock-sever/db.json`
