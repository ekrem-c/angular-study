## Completing and Submitting Your Solution
The process to submit the solution should be from a pull request from a fork.

+ Create a fork of the repository
+ Implement the functionality and follow any technology-specific instructions for ensuring code quality
+ Create a pull request from the forked repository (source) back to the original (destination).
+ Read the documents thoroughly to understand the tasks.
+ Create initial commit to mark the start of the development. 

## Recording Time Spent
The easiest way to record the amount of time you have spent on the solution for transperancy purposes is to 
create an initial commit with a comment of either `client start` or `api start`. If necessary to take a break 
from the solution, create a commit pair of `client pause`/`client restart`. Once you are complete with either the 
client or API, create a commit with the comment of `client initial` or `api initial`. After these commit markers, 
complete the integration between the client and API. There is no further need for commit markers at this point unless
you need to pause development. 

## Commit Per Story
Complete one story, then commit that code with the following text at the start of the comment `#<story-number>`

## Purpose
This allows for us to know how much time was spent on each piece of the solution. This helps us understand the 
strengths and weaknesses of your development skills.
